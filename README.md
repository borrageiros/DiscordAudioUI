## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your Discord Audio UI Streamer up and running.

### Prerequisites

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your system.

### 1. Build the Docker Image

Clone this repository and build the Docker image with the following command:

```bash
docker build -t discord-audio-ui .
```

### 2. Docker Hub Images üì¶

This project is automatically built and pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/borrageiros/DiscordAudioUI) for two different CPU architectures. You can pull the images directly instead of building them locally.

-   **`borrageiros/DiscordAudioUI:latest`** (for `linux/amd64`)
    This is the standard image for most desktop PCs, servers, and cloud environments (Intel/AMD CPUs).

    ```bash
    docker pull borrageiros/DiscordAudioUI:latest
    ```

-   **`borrageiros/DiscordAudioUI:arm64`** (for `linux/arm64`)
    Use this image for ARM-based systems like Raspberry Pi, Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs, or some cloud instances.

    ```bash
    docker pull borrageiros/DiscordAudioUI:arm64
    ```

> **Note**: When running a custom script (`custom.sh`), make sure any software you install is compatible with the architecture of the image you are using!

### 3. Register Commands

Before the first run, you need to register the slash commands with Discord's API. This requires your bot's token and client ID. Use the appropriate image tag for your system.

```bash
# For amd64 systems
docker run --rm \
  -e DISCORD_TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN" \
  -e DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID" \
  borrageiros/DiscordAudioUI:latest yarn register:commands

# For arm64 systems
docker run --rm \
  -e DISCORD_TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN" \
  -e DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID" \
  borrageiros/DiscordAudioUI:arm64 yarn register:commands
```

> **Note**: You only need to do this once, or whenever you change the command definitions.

### 4. Run the Container

Now you can run the main application. Here is an example `docker run` command. Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your own.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name discord-audio-ui \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
  -p 6080:6080 \
  -v ./custom.sh:/app/custom.sh \
  -v ./mozilla_data:/home/appuser/.mozilla \
  \
